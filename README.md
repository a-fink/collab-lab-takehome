# üóíÔ∏è Let‚Äôs look at some art

Your team has been developing an app that allows users to search the [Art Institute of Chicago](https://www.artic.edu/) (AIC)'s APIs for public domain artwork. You've inherited some code from a teammate ‚Äì¬†a React application with some components and some functions for interating with a search API. Your job is to finish the rest of the tasks your team has agreed on! We've listed those acceptance criteria in this document, as well as some tips for working with Art Institute of Chicago's APIs.

‚ùó **Please limit your time spent on this project to _one hour_.** If you do not finish all the acceptance criteria listed here, that's okay! Our goal is to give you something to discuss with your interviewer at the next stage, whether the project is feature-complete or not. You can chat with your interviewer about what you would do with more time.

## Local development setup

To get started, you'll need to initialize a new Git repository using this repository as a template. You can do that one of two ways:

- [with the Github GUI](#initialize-your-repo-from-this-template-with-the-github-gui), or
- [with the GitHub CLI](#initialize-your-repo-from-this-template-with-the-github-cli).

After that, proceed to the [acceptance criteria](#acceptance-criteria) section.

### Initialize your repo from this template with the GitHub GUI

1. Click the "Use this template" button on the GitHub page for this repo. It's located above this readme, and above the preview of the project's file structure.
2. On the next page, give your new repo a name. Make sure the repository is public!
3. Click "Create repository from template". Your repository will generate and you will be navigated to its GitHub page.
4. Click the "Code" button to reveal the command you can run to clone your repo to your computer, then click the "copy" button (it looks like a clipboard).

5. Run that code in your terminal
6. `cd` into your new directory
7. Run `npm ci` to install the project's dependencies

Now, to develop the app locally, run `npm start`. A new window will open in your browser. Happy coding!

### Initialize your repo from this template with the GitHub CLI

In your terminal, `cd` into the folder you want your project to live in and run the following commands:

```
# Generate a new repo from this template with the name `take-home-assignment`
# and clone it to your computer in a new folder named `take-home-assignment`
gh repo create take-home-assignment --template the-collab-lab/career-lab-assignment-next --public --clone
# Move into this new folder and install the project's dependencies
cd take-home-assignment && npm ci
```

Now, to develop the app locally, run `npm start`. A new window will open in your browser. Happy coding!

## Acceptance criteria

Your team has agreed on the following requirements for the app's MVP (minimum viable product). Your teammate has implemented a couple of these criteria already. Start with `./src/components/App.jsx` to familiarize yourself with their work, then build on top of it. You're gonna do great!

- [x] Create a `searchArtworks` function for making GET requests to `/search/artworks/`. See `src/utils/api.js`
  - [x] Request a local copy of data in `searchArtworks` to avoid making too many requests to the AIC `/artworks/search/` endpoint while the app is in development
  - [ ] **When the UI is complete**, ensure that `searchArtworks` makes requests to the AIC `/artworks/search/` endpoint, as described in "Working with the API"
- [x] Create a `SearchForm` component that will allow the user to perform a search. See `src/components/SearchForm.jsx`
  - [ ] Fix a known bug: the whole app refreshes when `SearchForm` is submitted
- [ ] In the `App` component, render
  - [x] the `SearchForm` component and
  - [ ] a list of results including _the name of the piece_ and _the artist who created the piece_.
- [ ] Render a new view when a user clicks a result. It could be called `ImageDetailsPage`.
- [ ] In the `ImageDetailsPage` component, render
  - [ ] a back button that, when clicked, returns the user to the list viewüí°, and
  - [ ] the artwork whose title the user just clicked on

üí° You might think to install React Router to handle the back button functionality. That's probably something you would do in a production application, but your team has agreed that React Router is _out of scope_ for this MVP. Instead, you can use [conditional rendering](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/conditional-rendering) to show and hide content!

Here's some logic you could use to approach the conditional rendering criterion:

- If no artwork is selected, render the list with the search form
- If an artwork is selected, instead render the `ImageDetailsPage` component
- If the back button on `ImageDetailsPage` is clicked, render the list with the search form

## üíª Working with the API

AIC maintains one API endpoint for requesting data from its catalog, and another API endpoint for requesting the images from the catalog. These APIs have [some dense documentation](https://www.artic.edu/open-access/public-api); we‚Äôve outlined the things you should know.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Read this section carefully.** You will need data from the catalog in order to request the images you want to show to the user!

### Requesting data from the catalog

You‚Äôll make requests to the `/artworks/search/` endpoint provided by AIC. You can build a request with a URL like the following:

> `https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/search?q={USER_QUERY}&query[term][is_public_domain]=true&fields=artist_title,date_display,id,image_id,thumbnail.alt_text,thumbnail.width,thumbnail.height,title`

These URLs are quite long, but you don't need to worry about exactly what each part means. You'll need to replace `{USER_QUERY}` with the thing your user searched for in the catalog. If your user searches for ‚Äúcats‚Äù, your request url becomes:

> `https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/search?q=cats&query[term][is_public_domain]=true&fields=artist_title,date_display,id,image_id,thumbnail.alt_text,thumbnail.width,thumbnail.height,title`.

Try it our for yourself: [open the ‚Äúcats‚Äù query in your browser](https://api.artic.edu/api/v1/artworks/search?q=cats&query[term][is_public_domain]=true&fields=artist_title,date_display,id,image_id,thumbnail.alt_text,thumbnail.width,thumbnail.height,title).

#### Working with data returned from the catalog

Requests to the `/artworks/seearch/` endpoint return **a JSON object**. This object has _a lot_ of information. You should focus on the `data` property, which is an array of objects. Each object is shaped as follows:

- `artist_title`: a string indicating the known artist of the piece
- `date_display`: a string indicating the known production date of the piece
- `id`: a number representing the item‚Äôs unique id
- `image_id`: a string referencing the id of the full image for this catalog item
- `thumbnail`: an object with the following properties: `alt_text`, `width`, and `height`
- `title`: a string indicating the title of the piece

### üñºÔ∏è Requesting an image

AIC provides an endpoint dedicated to serving images. These image URLs are structured as follows:

```
https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/{IMAGE_ID}/full/843,/0/default.jpg
```

You should replace `{IMAGE_ID}` with an image ID from the data you retrieve from the `/artworks/search/` endpoint. You can use the resulting URL in an `img` element to show that artwork to your users. For instance, the following `img` element would render Georges Seurat's _La grande jette_ in the browser:

```html
<img
	src="https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/1adf2696-8489-499b-cad2-821d7fde4b33/full/843,/0/default.jpg"
/>
```

You can also [open _La grande jette_ in your browser](https://www.artic.edu/iiif/2/1adf2696-8489-499b-cad2-821d7fde4b33/full/843,/0/default.jpg), if you‚Äôd like!
